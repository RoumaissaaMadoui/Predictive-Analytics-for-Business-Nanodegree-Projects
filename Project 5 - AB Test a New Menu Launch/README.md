# AB Test a New Menu Launch
<p align=justify>
Round Roasters, a coffee restaurant in the United States of America. 
The executive team conducted a market test with a new menu and needs 
to figure whether the new menu can drive enough sales to offset the 
cost of marketing the new menu. This project is about analyzing the 
A/B test and write up a recommendation on whether the Round Roasters 
chain should launch this new menu.

## The Business Problem
<p align=justify>
Round Roasters is an upscale coffee chain with locations in the western 
United States of America. The past few years have resulted in stagnant 
growth at the coffee chain, and a new management team was put in place 
to reignite growth at their stores.
</p>
<p align=justify>
The first major growth initiative is to introduce gourmet sandwiches to 
the menu, along with limited wine offerings. The new management team 
believes that a television advertising campaign is crucial to drive people 
into the stores with these new offerings.
 </p>
<p align=justify>
However, the television campaign will require a significant boost in the 
companyâ€™s marketing budget, with an unknown return on investment (ROI). 
Additionally, there is concern that current customers will not buy into 
the new menu offerings. To minimize risk, the management team decides to 
test the changes in two cities with new television advertising. Denver and 
Chicago cities were chosen to participate in this test because the stores 
in these two cities (or markets) perform similarly to all stores across 
the entire chain of stores; performance in these two markets would be a 
good proxy to predict how well the updated menu performs.
</p>
<p align=justify>
The test ran for a period of 12 weeks (2016-April-29 to 2016-July-21) 
where five stores in each of the test markets offered the updated menu 
along with television advertising.

### Details
- <p align=justify> The predicted impact on profitability should be enough to justify the increased marketing budget: at least 18% increase in profit growth compared to the comparative period while compared to the control stores.</p>
