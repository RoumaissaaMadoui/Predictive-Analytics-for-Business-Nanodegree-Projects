# Combining Predictive Techniques
<p align=justify>
A company has 85 grocery stores and it is planning to open 10 new stores at the beginning of the year. 
All stores use the same store format for selling their products. Up until now, the company has treated all stores similarly, 
shipping the same amount of product to each store. This is beginning to cause problems as stores are suffering from product 
surpluses in some product categories and shortages in others. This project is about providing an analytical support to make 
decisions about store formats and inventory planning.
</p>

## Task 1: Determining Store Format
<p align=justify>
To remedy the product surplus and shortages, the company wants to introduce different store formats. 
Each store format will have a different product selection in order to better match local demand. 
The actual building sizes will not change, just the product selection and internal layouts.
</p>

### Instructions
- Determine the optimal number of store formats based on sales data.

## Task 2: Store Format for New Stores

<p align=justify>
The grocery store chain has 10 new stores opening up at the beginning of the year. 
The company wants to determine which store format each of the new stores should have. 
 </p>
 
### Instructions
- <p align=justify> Develop a model that predicts which segment a store falls into based on the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of the population that resides in the area around each new store.</p> 
- Use the model to predict the best store format for each of the 10 new stores.

## Task 3: Forecasting Produce Sales
<p align=justify>
Fresh produce has a short life span, and due to increasing costs, the company wants to have an accurate monthly sales forecast.
</p>

### Instructions
- Prepare a monthly forecast for produce sales for the full year of 2016 for both existing and new stores.
