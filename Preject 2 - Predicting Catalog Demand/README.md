## The Business Problem
<p align=justify>
Last year a company that manufactures and sells high-end home goods sent out its first print catalog, and is preparing to send out this year's catalog in the coming months. The company has 250 new customers from their mailing list that they want to send the catalog to. The company wants to determine how much profit it can expect from sending the catalog to these customers.

### Details
- The costs of printing and distributing is $6.50 per catalog.
- The average gross margin (price - cost) on all products sold through the catalog is 50%.
- The company will not send the catalog out to these new customers unless the expected profit contribution exceeds $10,000.

## Instructions
