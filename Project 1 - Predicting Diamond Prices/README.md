# Predicting Diamond Prices
<p align=justify>
  A jewelry company wants to put in a bid to purchase a large set of diamonds, but is unsure how much it should bid. This project is about using the results
  from a predictive model to make a recommendation on how much the jewelry company should bid for the diamonds.
</p>

## Project Details
<p align=justify>
  A diamond distributor has recently decided to exit the market and has put up a set of 3,000 diamonds up for auction. 
  Seeing this as a great opportunity to expand its inventory, a jewelry company has shown interest in making a bid. To decide how much to bid,
  the companyâ€™s analytics team used a large database of diamond prices to build a linear regression model to predict the price of a diamond based on its attributes.
</p> 

The linear regression model provides the equation below:

<p align=center>
  <strong>Price</strong> = -5,269 + 8,413 x <strong>Carat</strong> + 158.1 x <strong>Cut</strong> + 454 x <strong>Clarity</strong>
</p>

<p align=justify>
  The following diagram represents the analysis at a high level. Since the model is already built, the analysis will focus on the right side of the diagram.

## Instructions 
  <ul>
  <li>
    <p align=justify>Use the equation provided by the linear regression model to predict diamond prices for the set of 3,000 diamonds and make a recommendation for how much the company should bid for the entire set.
    </p>
    </li>
    </ul>

## Data
- [diamonds.csv](https://github.com/RoumaissaaMadoui/Predictive-Analytics-for-Business-Nanodegree-Projects/blob/main/Project%201%20-%20Predicting%20Diamond%20Prices/Data/diamonds.csv) - contains carat, cut, clarity, and price information for each diamond in the dataset used to build the regression model.
  
- [new_diamonds.csv](https://github.com/RoumaissaaMadoui/Predictive-Analytics-for-Business-Nanodegree-Projects/blob/main/Project%201%20-%20Predicting%20Diamond%20Prices/Data/new-diamonds.csv) - contains carat, cut, and clarity information for the diamonds the company would like to purchase.
