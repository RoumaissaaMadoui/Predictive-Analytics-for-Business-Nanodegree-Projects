## [Combining Predictive Techniques](https://github.com/RoumaissaaMadoui/Predictive-Analytics-for-Business-Nanodegree-Projects/tree/main/Project%206%20-%20Combining%20Predictive%20Techniques)

<p align=justify>
A company has 85 grocery stores and it is planning to open 10 new stores at the beginning of the year. All stores use 
the same store format for selling their products. Up until now, the company has treated all stores similarly, shipping 
the same amount of product to each store. This is beginning to cause problems as stores are suffering from product surpluses
in some product categories and shortages in others. This project is about providing an analytical support to make decisions 
about store formats and inventory planning.
