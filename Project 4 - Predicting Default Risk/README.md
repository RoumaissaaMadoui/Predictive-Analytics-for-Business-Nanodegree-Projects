# Predicting Default Risk
<p align=justify>
A young and small bank (been in operations for two years) needs to come up with an efficient solution to classify new customers on whether they can be approved for a loan or not.
</p>

## The Business Problem
<p align=justify>
A small bank needs to determine if customers are creditworthy to give a loan to. A loan team typically gets 200 loan applications per week and approves them by hand.
</p>
<p align=justify>
Due to a financial scandal that hit a competitive bank last week, suddenly the small bank has an influx of new people applying for loans in it instead of the other bank in the city.
</p>
<p align=justify>
The bank manager sees this new influx as a great opportunity and wants the loan team to figure out how to process all of these loan applications within one week.
</p>
